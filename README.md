# Dice Value Injector
Allows for swapping dice rolls in Foundry VTT with in-person dice rolls.

## Installation
In the Game Modules tab of Foundry, enter https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aeglicious/fvtt-dice-value-injector/master/module.json under Install Modules.

## Usage
The result of any die rolls can be manually entered into a dialog box, or the dice can be rolled randomly by the system as is normal via the decline option. This does not currently work properly with nested rolls such as critical damage in some modules.
