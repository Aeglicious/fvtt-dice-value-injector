# Dice Value Injector
Allows for swapping dice rolls in Foundry VTT with in-person dice rolls.

## Installation
In the Game Modules tab of Foundry, enter https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aeglicious/fvtt-dice-value-injector/master/module.json under Install Modules.

## Usage
When holding the Alt key and pressing a macro that would generate a roll result in chat, the result of any die rolls can be manually entered into a dialog box. This does not currently work properly with nested rolls such as critical damage in some modules.
